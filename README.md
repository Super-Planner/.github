## 💡 About AquaVision

AquaVision is a modular, intelligent system designed to enhance **demand forecasting** and **resource optimization** in water distribution companies. Built as a full-stack platform with a focus on real-world impact, AquaVision leverages AI and optimization algorithms to improve delivery efficiency, minimize wastage, and support smarter operational decisions.

> 🚀 Built for Alpine Waters. Scalable across commerce and logistics sectors.

## 🧠 What We’re Solving

- ⚙️ Unreliable demand estimations leading to stockouts/overstocking  
- 🚚 Suboptimal resource allocation (vehicles, routes, staff)  
- 📊 Lack of accessible real-time forecasting insights for decision-makers  
- 📉 Manual planning that doesn’t adapt to real-time data
